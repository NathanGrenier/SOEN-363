# DDL Queries
## Part 1 [20 pts] 
Provide the DDL queries for creating the database tables that correspond entities and their relationships.
- Use internal integer primary keys (no TMDB/IMDB id).
- Include referential integrity / unique constraints.
- Include full country name and short code for countries.
- Create foreign tables for genres, content rating, and keywords.
- Use singular names for tables / relations.
- [!IMPORTANT] Make sure your database include a few records with missing IMDB-ids. You may manually delete the IMDB data and/or use fake information.
