# Database DDL
## Part 5 [8 pts]
Provide the DML queries that populates the data in the database. You may back up your database as SQL (see pddump [11] as an example). Make sure you create at least 50 movies. Remove unnecessary statements from your sql dump file. Note that the graders will run the DDL queries in the previous section to create your database. Make sure the queries are provided in correct order.
